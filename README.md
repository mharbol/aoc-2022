# Marcus' Branch
This is my branch for Advent of Code. I aim to explore a new part of C++ syntax/programming with
each day of the challenge. Unfortunately, my first day with Mac C++ dev is just getting clang to
work so we'll see how this goes. Each day is its own directory so just go from there. Please forgive
me if there are some other programs in the mix just to make sure my programs are not spitting
out pure nonsense.
## Rollup of Days
### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
Just getting clang to work. Turns out all I had to do was use `clang++`. Oof.
### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)
Becoming familiar with `map` before I really need it.
### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)
Dipping my toes in the water with header files. Decided to do two appreaches to the solution;
one with nested for loops (nice and quick to write) and the other with a hash set to get silky
smooth linear time vibes.
### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4)
Really fell of the bandwangon starting on the 4th (only addressing it on the 10th).
Gonna progressivly get back on it attacking the easier parts first.
Order of precidence: custom file iterator, stacks, custom classes.
Day 4 feels like a good start for all this madness.
Probably coming Tuesday the 13th at the earliest.
### [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/5)
Getting back into the swing of things with `stack`s.
Got to relearn that going stack-stack makes part 2 sooooo much easier.
### [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/6)
Explaination to come.
### [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/7)
This was harder than it should have been thanks to python.
Kept thinking I was doing something wrong but it turns out I just didn't understand python
pointers well enough.
With a typed language it is/was so much easier to attack.
### [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/8)
### [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/9)
This one distinguished the pack. A lot of small conditions to make it challenging.
Fortunately treated it like segments of a snake early on and made part 2 pretty easy.
### [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/10)
Hardest part here was understanding the wording of the input.
The pixel format of part 2 was a nice touch; this was a fun day.
### [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11)
Explaination to come.
### [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12)
Explaination to come.
### [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/13)
This day was so much fun. Will have to refine and save the `NestedListComparitor` tree
for future use.
### [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14)
This one is in the works.
